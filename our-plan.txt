Session detail page
- display a session from the db
- update that session on save (update)
-- service update call
- save a new session (create)
-- service create call
- route for this page
-- the route should tell me which session I'm working with
- trigger this route from the session-list page
-- add new button will route to the detail page with
--- some kinda blank or new indicator
--- click on the row to edit it
(All done)

SessionRating Component
- display the avg rating
- rate the session
- service to work with ratings (mock data for now)
- this component should work for detail page and list page
- no routing for this, implemented via selector
- select dropdown (1,2,etc)
- v1 not fancy, just working for now
-- Rating can be anu number??

Back End Security
- secure API endpoints (I'm assuming the authUser)

Front End Security
- Auth Service (singleton)
-- responsible for determining isAuthenticated
-- resonsible for hitting login endpoint
- secure pages or routes
-- want this to be easy to implement everywhere
- when hitting endpoints from Front End how to include secruity token
